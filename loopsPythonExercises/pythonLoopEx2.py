# Second Coding Session:
# Create a list of ingredients you'd use to make a cake (minumum of 4 elements)
# As you iterate through the list, print out "We have that ingredient!"
# If you come across the ingredients of either flour or sugar, print out the statement "Wait, we don't have that!" and use the keyword break
#
# Complete this challenge with a for loop. If you have more time, try creating a while loop solution as a bonus!
